Welcome to the repository of a new rails project I'm working on for [Best Pest Control Boston](http://bestpestcontrolboston.com), a Boston based pest control company. I have a plan to develop a powerful website for this company in the coming weeks. 

This is actually my first time working with a pest control company near me. As a matter of fact, I've never built a website for an exterminator in the Boston area or anywhere in New England for that matter. However, I have had great success building and rankning some incredible sites in highly competitve niches, but keywords like exterminator Boston are extremely difficult to rank for. It is a compettive market and I'm learning that pest control is in high-demand in the area, especially with all the apartment buildings which can be breeding grounds for bed bugs, cockroaches, beetles, etc. 

## Boston Pest Control – a competitive yet important phrase

I started working with my local pest extermintor for a few months now and have been generating leads mainly through paid ads. My ad campaigns have shown me the best phrases to rank for and incoporate into their new website and one of the most valuable and important phrases is [Boston Pest Control](http://bestpestcontrolboston.com/) and bed bugs Boston. 

Now that I know the important phrases to incoporate into their website I have no doubt about the success of this project!
